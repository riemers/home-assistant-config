Automations that makes you go 'hmm, thats intresting nice, i should have a go with it'
***
[Lights out patio](https://github.com/riemers/home-assistant-config/blob/master/extraconfig/automation/police/light-out-patio.yaml)
- Always hate it when people turn on lights during the day while its not needed *at all*

[Alert when door is open](https://github.com/riemers/home-assistant-config/blob/master/extraconfig/automation/frontdoor/alert.yaml)
- So your wife left the front door open, god knows why. Get an alert with a picture which you can press and it streams the cam. (ios only)

[You like bass? So does your wallet](https://github.com/riemers/home-assistant-config/blob/master/extraconfig/automation/receiver/denon.yaml)
- My subwoofer is about 20+ watt usage when idle. This little gem does nothing more then to check if the receiver is on, if so turn the subwoofer on too. Receiver off, subwoofer off. There, i saved the environment, time to start the bbq.

[Z-wave done](https://github.com/riemers/home-assistant-config/blob/master/extraconfig/automation/startup/zwavedone.yaml)
- Even though the config panel shows you when its done.. i just don't want to wait and find out. Got things to do!

[No real tesla charger unlock](https://github.com/riemers/home-assistant-config/blob/master/extraconfig/automation/tesla/unlockwhenfull.yaml)
- So i don't have the super duper tesla charger on my wall, just a simple one. Because of this i don't have that button to unlock it from the car and the app takes ages. (or via the car) so when i open the frontdoor, check if its full and still hooked up, if yes -> unlock it! Also one in that folder to warm the car but any fool (B.A.) can think of that one ;p

[Reset automations](https://github.com/riemers/home-assistant-config/blob/master/extraconfig/automation/timebased/resetautomations.yaml)
- Just what the name says. I have automations for the house, but the wife wants to mop the floor. Not handy to let the Roomba go over a wet floor. So hence she turns it off via the Tablet on the wall. This flips it back on. Simple jet good to have.

[Need food now](https://github.com/riemers/home-assistant-config/blob/master/extraconfig/automation/zoneactions/needshopping.yaml)
- I got zones for all the shopping places for food. So when the wife is there it will alert me at home saying 'if you need something, call here now!'

[Boss mode](https://github.com/riemers/home-assistant-config/blob/master/extraconfig/automation/zoneactions/fromworktohome.yaml)
- In the middle of a sweet game? But you don't want to quit instantly when the boss comes home? This alert will tell you when the wife is coming home and how long it will take (including traffic) via the speakers. Only when your home of course!

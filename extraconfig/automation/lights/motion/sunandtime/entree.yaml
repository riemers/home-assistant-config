# got a door sensor and a motion sensor. Since the door is from glass it doesn't see motion.
# To please the WAF the door sensor is quicker and turns the light on faster.
# It then still triggers an event if motion is detected but doesn't do anything if the light is already on
# Same for turning off, both triggers are used.

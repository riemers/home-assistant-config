 # don't forget you get new entities. You might want a nice icon for it. To do so go to configuration -> customization.
 # Then select the new light.<device> and change the icon attribute. That way you don't have to keep it in here.
 # and then hide the switches themself, again this can be done in the customization part (but is not a requiment, just don't use them)

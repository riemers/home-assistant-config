Packages that makes you go 'hmm, thats intresting nice, i should have a go with it'
***
I use packages when i want to group stuff together. Sometimes i have a dozen or so automations and then i just chuck it into an automation to keep stuff clean. Doorbird is a good example where you have a device, a camera and an automation. Best to keep those together by means of a package. Shitty resolution on those btw..

`Do note that where credit is due, it would be in the package itself with a link (if any) to where i got it from`

[Roomba](https://github.com/riemers/home-assistant-config/blob/master/extraconfig/packages/roomba.yaml)
* Does everything. Includes a part where if we all leave the house (and no baby sitters) it turns on in the morning. Only in the morning since if the dogs shits, she usually shits later and we all know [how that looks right?](http://i.imgur.com/msu6O6W.png)

[Awning](https://github.com/riemers/home-assistant-config/blob/master/extraconfig/packages/awning.yaml)
* Too hot, shades go down. Too much rain/wind/cold/fireworks shades go up.

[I'am not a switch, i'am a lamp dammit!](https://github.com/riemers/home-assistant-config/blob/master/extraconfig/packages/customizelights.yaml)
* Pretty straightforward. Change a switch to a light.

[Load cells](https://github.com/riemers/home-assistant-config/blob/master/extraconfig/packages/loadcell.yaml)
* Too much time on your hands? Make a loadcell for your bed with a ESP device. Then get this and do magic when you jump in the bed.

[Presence](https://github.com/riemers/home-assistant-config/blob/master/extraconfig/packages/presence.yaml)
* Found this somewhere too, idea is that if you come home or just wake up the state will be "Just home" or "Just left" or "Just awake" on which you can do silly things.

[Thrascan](https://github.com/riemers/home-assistant-config/blob/master/extraconfig/packages/trashcan.yaml)
* Like many others, i think there was one with actions on phones too but its worth a mention. This one is adjusted to fit my needs.

[Washing machine](https://github.com/riemers/home-assistant-config/blob/master/extraconfig/packages/washingmachine.yaml)
* The good old "take the wash out" this really should have like a direct feed to the brain for the wife, but we are not there yet.
